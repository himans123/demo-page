<p>
    The Aim is a target or purpose that every person has in life. It directs a person and motivates them to achieve
    them.
    Every Individual must set well-defined objectives to achieve in life. It helps them to understand the career path
    and motivates them to move forward.
    A goal in life gives a person enough joy and happiness and sets a leading example for others to live life in the
    best possible manner.
    To achieve your goals, you need to set the right purpose and break them into small sections and prepare a timeline
    to make them.
    A person with a thirst to achieve must be proactive, embrace failure, be well-balanced, and tell people about your
    goals with confidence. Stay positive and keep track of your goals.
    Avoid all negativity around you, seek guidance when needed from others, be open to feedback and criticisms, and
    reset your goal.
    My Aim in life is to become a teacher as I consider it as the noblest of all the professions. A teacher serves
    his/her society and country in their best possible way.
    As my goal, I wish to impart the right education and inculcate refined qualities among young minds and make them the
    torch-bearers of the country.
    I wish to create a family atmosphere for the students in the school and teach my students as Gurus of ancient times.
    The best way to stay motivated and focused is by visualizing your achievement and working hard to reach your goal.

 Our Friendship
    Our friendship started when my best friend came in as a new admission to our class. Both of us were hesitant to talk to each other at first, but gradually we developed a bond.
    I remember the first time my best friend tried to talk to me; I rolled my eyes because I thought there was no use and we wouldnt hit it off. However, to my surprise, we became best friends by the end of the session year.
    
    We learned so many things about each other and found out that our taste in music and fashion was so similar. Since then, there was no stopping us. We spent all our time together and our friendship became the talk of the class. We used to help each other out in studies and visited each other’s homes as well. We made sure to have lunch together on Sundays. We also used to watch movies and cartoons together.
     On our summer break, we even went to summer camp together and made a lot of memories. Once during the summer holidays, she also accompanied me to my maternal grandparents’ home. We had a fabulous time there. Moreover, we even invented our own handshake which only both of us knew. Through this bond, I learned that family doesn’t end with blood because my best friend was no less than my family. Friendship is one relationship that you choose, unlike all other relationships.</p></PRE>
